File-Locate-Harder version 0.06
===============================

File::Locate::Harder provides a generalized "locate" method to access
the file system indexes used by the "locate" command-line utility.
It is intended to be a relatively portable way for perl code to
quickly ascertain what files are present on the current system.

This code is essentially a wrapper around multiple different methods
of accessing a locate database: it makes an effort to use the fastest
method that works.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Class::Base

Test::Trap  (used by tests)

File::Locate will be used if it's available, but does not
depend on it.  If File::Locate is not working, it falls back on
command-line locate (standard on many systems, sometimes found
in a package such as "findutils").
